# Regression-analysis-on-sales-data
Considering a Meddicorp Company and its sales data in three regions of the United States: The South, the West, and the Midwest, which are further divided into territories overseen by regional sales managers, for the year 2003. The problem is to detect whether there is a linear relationship between its sales in each of the territories and the bonuses paid to the salespeople working in those territories by the company.


Methodology adopted:
For determining the relationship, we take into account the effects of
advertising, bonus, market share currently held by Meddicorp in
each territory (MKTSHR), and largest competitor’s sales in each
territory (COMPET).
As such the variables to be used in the study include:
Y= Meddicorp’s sales (in $000) in each territory for 2003
(SALES) = the amount Meddicorp spent on advertisement in each
territory (in $00) in 2003
(ADV) = the total amount of bonuses paid in each territory (in $00) in
2003
(BONUS)
(MKTSHR) = Market share currently held by Meddicorp in each
territory
(COMPET) = Largest competitor’s sales in each territory.
